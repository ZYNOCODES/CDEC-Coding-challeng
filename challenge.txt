Problem 07: Palindrom Number

Problem Statement and Constraints
Given an integer X, return true if X is a palindrome and false otherwise.
An input string is valid if:
Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.
Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
Practices
Example 1:
Input:
x = 121
Output:
true
Explanation:
121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
Example 2:
Input:
x = -121
Output:
false
Explanation:
From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.
Example 3:
Input:
x = 10
Output:
false
Explanation:
Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome.
